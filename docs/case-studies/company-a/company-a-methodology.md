# Company A: Consulting Methodology

**Purpose**: Document the actual methodology being used so Phoenix can codify it

---

## Engagement Structure

### Team Composition
- **Strategy Team**: [Roles and responsibilities]
- **Dev Team**: [Roles and responsibilities]
- **Client Stakeholders**: [Who we're working with]

### Timeline
- **Total Duration**: 6 months
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2)**: Discovery + Strategy + Initial Architecture
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-6)**: Build + Iterate + Deploy

### Coordination Mechanisms
- **Strategy ↔ Dev Sync**: [How often, what format]
- **Client Check-ins**: [Frequency and purpose]
- **Decision Documentation**: [Where/how decisions are recorded]

---

## Discovery Phase Methodology

### Step 1: Initial Assessment
**Activities**:
- Review what they think they need
- Challenge assumptions (e.g., "Is tech modernization the real solution?")
- Identify potential misalignment between stated need and real opportunity

**Artifacts Created**:
- Initial problem statement
- Hypothesis about real opportunity

### Step 2: Deep Dive Discovery
**Activities**:
- [Structured interviews]
- [Process mapping]
- [Economic analysis]
- [Market research]
- [Competitive analysis]

**Artifacts Created**:
- As-Is business model canvas
- Process maps
- Economic model
- Market opportunity sizing

### Step 3: Opportunity Identification
**Activities**:
- Pattern matching to successful transformations
- Scenario modeling (what if we did X vs Y?)
- Economic validation of alternatives

**Artifacts Created**:
- Transformation scenarios
- Economic comparison
- Risk/opportunity analysis

### Step 4: Strategic Design
**Activities**:
- Workshop with leadership on transformation options
- Co-design To-Be operating model
- Validate with potential customers/partners

**Artifacts Created**:
- To-Be business model canvas
- Platform architecture concept
- Transformation roadmap

## Parallel Development Methodology

### Initial Architecture Design
**Input**: As-Is understanding (incomplete strategy)

**What we design**:
- [ ] Core data model for existing process
- [ ] API structure for platform capabilities
- [ ] Integration points to current systems
- [ ] Deployment architecture
- [ ] Security and access control

**Principle**: Design what we *know* won't change, stay flexible on what *might* change

### Strategy → Dev Handoff Pattern
**Trigger**: Strategy team has new insight or decision

**Process**:
1. [Document decision/insight]
2. [Assess technical implications]
3. [Create dev ticket/spec if needed]
4. [Prioritize with dev team]
5. [Implement and validate]

**Communication Channel**: [Tool/process used]

### Iteration Rhythm
- **Weekly**: Strategy team shares progress, dev shares blockers
- **Bi-weekly**: Joint planning session
- **Monthly**: Client demo and feedback

---

## Decision-Making Framework

### What Requires Client Approval
- Strategic direction changes
- Major architectural pivots
- Investment/scope changes

### What We Decide Autonomously
- Technical implementation details
- Tactical process adjustments
- Tool/technology choices (within constraints)

### How We Handle Disagreement
- [Process for resolving conflicts]

---

## Tools & Artifacts

### Documentation
- **Strategy**: [Where/how documented]
- **Technical**: [Where/how documented]
- **Decisions**: [Where/how documented]

### Collaboration Tools
- [Communication platform]
- [Project management]
- [Design/modeling tools]

---

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Success
- [ ] Clear understanding of As-Is
- [ ] Validated transformation opportunity
- [ ] Client buy-in on To-Be vision
- [ ] Initial architecture built and validated

### Phase 2 Success
- [ ] Platform capabilities delivered
- [ ] Pilot customer/franchisee validated
- [ ] Economics proven out
- [ ] Operational readiness

### What Could Be Automated/Augmented
- [Activity] → [How agent could help]
- [Activity] → [How agent could help]

### What Requires Human Expertise
- [Activity] → [Why human judgment is essential]
- [Activity] → [Why human judgment is essential]

### Patterns to Extract
- [Pattern identified] → [How to generalize]
- [Pattern identified] → [How to generalize]
