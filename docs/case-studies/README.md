# Phoenix Case Studies

This directory captures real-world transformation engagements that inform Phoenix platform development.

## Purpose

Each case study serves as:
1. **Validation** - Real problems, real solutions, real outcomes
2. **Methodology documentation** - How we actually do the work
3. **Pattern extraction** - What's repeatable across companies
4. **Reference architecture** - Templates and blueprints for future engagements

## Active Case Studies

### Company A: Scaling Ceiling → Platform Transformation

**Status**: Active (Month 1 of 6)

**Problem Statement**:
- Growing 25% annually without changes
- Proven business model works in current locations
- Can't scale to national footprint due to operational constraints
- Previous consultant proposed $1M+ tech modernization (lift-and-shift)

**Real Opportunity**:
- Transform from service provider to platform business
- SaaS franchise model enables others to replicate their success
- Technology enables business model transformation, not just efficiency

**Engagement Approach**:
- Parallel strategy + dev teams working in lock-step
- Initial architecture from As-Is understanding
- Strategy evolves → dev adapts architecture iteratively
- 6-month timeline for transformation

**Phoenix Learning Objectives**:
- Document discovery questions that revealed platform opportunity
- Track strategy-to-dev handoff mechanisms
- Identify what could be agent-accelerated vs. requires human judgment
- Capture architectural patterns that emerge
- Measure time spent on different activities (discovery, analysis, design, coordination)

**Documentation**:
- [company-a-discovery.md](company-a/company-a-discovery.md) - Discovery process and insights
- [company-a-architecture.md](company-a/company-a-architecture.md) - Technical architecture evolution
- [company-a-methodology.md](company-a/company-a-methodology.md) - Consulting methodology used
- [company-a-timeline.md](company-a/company-a-timeline.md) - Week-by-week progress and learnings
