# Agent Prompts and Specifications

This directory contains the system prompts and specifications for Project Phoenix agents.

## The Sentinel

**File**: [sentinel-prompt.md](sentinel-prompt.md)

**Purpose**: Critical validation and bias detection agent that applies Charlie Munger's latticework of mental models to transformation decisions.

**Mode**: Advisory/parallel stream - non-blocking but highly visible

**Key Capabilities**:
- Inversion analysis ("How would this fail?")
- Incentive auditing ("What behaviors are we rewarding?")
- Cognitive bias detection
- Circle of competence validation
- Lollapalooza effect identification

**Usage**:
- Consultants query anytime: "Sentinel, what are we missing about this sales redesign?"
- Reviews agent proposals in workspace graphs
- Flags concerns but doesn't block promotion
- Proactively surfaces insights when detecting dangerous patterns

**Value**: Prevents groupthink, challenges assumptions, identifies perverse incentives before they cause harm.
